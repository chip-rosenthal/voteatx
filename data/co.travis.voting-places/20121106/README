Nov 6, 2012 -- General Election (Presidential)

Got a *GREAT* dataset ("chipG12_WEBLoad_FINAL.xlsx") from Travis County
Elections Division.

First, I manually burst the spreadsheet into individual CSV files
("chipG12_WEBLoad_FINAL_XXXXXX.csv"), one file per sheet.

Then the "generate.rb" script is run to process these files into
"Voting_Places.dat", using a new format that is imported by
FindIt::Feature::Travis_CO_TX_US::VotingPlaceData.
