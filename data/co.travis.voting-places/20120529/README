The "GA12-May_12_EDay_Polling_Places_Guide_Final.xls", file is the source
to a PDF "voting place" document published by Travis County. I extracted
the locations and did a batch geolocation to obtain the resulting
dataset. The quality is poor: there are locations with missing lat/lng
information and locations with wrong lat/lng inforation.
